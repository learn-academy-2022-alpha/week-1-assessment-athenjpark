# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the software that is associated with Github. Github is the online platform that acts as a retriever and a storage for information and code.

  Researched answer: Git is a software that is able to keep track of changes made to any files and is most often used amongst programmers and developers so that they are able to collaborate on projects efficiently. The biggest difference between Git and Github is that Git is an online tool that programmers and developers can download locally to create and make any changes to code. Github is an online platform for developers who consistently utilize the software Git. It essentially acts as a container storage for all types of code and developers can retrieve the code from Github to their local computers so that they are able to collaborate with other developers efficiently.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Logical operators and equality operators will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: Logical operators, equality operators, and relational operators will return a boolean value. Logical operators include the and, or, and not which are denoted by &&, ||, and ! respectively. The logical && states that both sides of the statement must be true. The logical || states that at least one side of the statement must be true. The logical ! states that whatever the statement is, the ! will negate that and make it the opposite. Equality operators include the == and === which denote to 'loosely equal to' and 'strictly equal to', respectively. Lastly, relational operators include the >, <, >=, and <= which essentially tries to find a relationship between two values.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index is the position of a character within a string or the element of an array. Indexes will always start counting from zero instead of one. The difference between an index and a value is that indexes give information regarding the position of a specific character or element while the value is just looking at what that specific character or element is equal to.

  Researched answer: Indexes can be described as a "storage location" while values can be described as the contents of an element within a specific storage location.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the process of repeating a set of computational procedures.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeating a set of computational procedures a specified number of times. Iteration is most often used for loops in JavaScript which will perform a specific action after looping through every item within an array.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques include being patient with each other and making sure that both parties are understanding and open-minded towards each other's thought processes and proposed solutions to specific coding problems. The roles in pair programming include the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is responsible for typing out the code while the Navigator is responsible for guiding the Driver in the right direction by letting the Driver know what to type.

  Researched answer: Proper pair programming makes it so that cognitive load is distributed between two people instead of just one person. Additionally, having another pair of eyes to look at a block of code is very useful in catching another person's mistakes. Having a partner will keep you accountable and talking about coding with someone can also help in solidifying a deeper understanding of the material. The Driver is responsible for typing the information while the Navigator informs the Driver of what to type out. It is crucial that there is consistent communication during this process so that both parties fully understand what is going on at every moment. It is also important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes so that both parties can experience both roles.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are built in methods that are specific to arrays.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: Objects are a datatype that contain collections of key:values pairs.

4. Method: A method is when a function belongs to an object.

5. Classes: Classes are the blueprints for objects.
